On windows:
The base memory usage is 3MB at startup.
Regular use and Runtime of 5 min grew the memory to 12MB.

Attempting to fix the issue by using a threadpool with fixed size, still persisting.
Attempting to fix it by forcing     uint8_t server_endpoints_count = 1; to be one inside Client, curl_easy_setopt(curl_handle, CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS, 1L);, still persists.

Updates no loenr trigger memory growth, only commands, meaning there is an unbound memory growth in the command parsing and handling, growth is still observed in
empty updates, meainig it is most likely the json parsing.


Memomory fragmentation because of stupid stack allocation behaviors, I centralized my http_buffer as a member of the base bot and made all the http requests
write into it.

I learned something about the scoped loops in order to make the stack calls unwind, really important.

These implimentation reduced stack fragmentation and decreased the slope of growth but it is still growing despite all with each command sent;

The issue I have is that memory should still at least peek and decrease at a certain point, despite all my optimization efforts this still ellude me.

Even in idle state the memory still grows, idle meaning recieving empty updates.

Each command adds 400KB in memory usage.
then 200KB after reaching 8MB.

forced json objects to destroy, still theere no solution;
