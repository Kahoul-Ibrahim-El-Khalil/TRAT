check the uplaoding file mechanism, the screenshots are takes but no able to be uploaded.

the shelling capabilities are minimal, the path handling is autrachious, work on a mechanism that pipes the output to a file, and 
uploades it directely, this way output of big commands is actually treatable.

same thing with scripting, instead of scripting commands indifinitely, work on an intuitive mechanism to executes scripts in the shell directely.

impliment extendable command logic dependent on the tooling found in the system path, this way I can actually dynamically have 
commands, for instance it will search for all commands in the usr/ directory on linux and on windows all the things in windows path, become extendible commands, this is an unordered map of key, paths values, and a special handler must be implimented for such behavior
