--TelegramBotApi::Handler

The Server is the interface where the ports and ip endpoints are defined, it has a refernece of a Drogon
Singelton that it passes it to DrogonRatServer::Handler that it composites over it.

The DrogonRatServer::Handler is where the main logic of handling url paths happens, it handles /method
on its own but delegates bot{token} to its member TelegramBotApi::Handler.

class Server {
    private:
      Handler handler;
  }

class Handler {
    private:
        drogon_orm_database_db; //connecting to the database will fetch the tok
        std::vector<std::string> tokens = {}
        std::vector<TelegramBotApi::Handler> bot_handler;
        
    handleBotUrlPath()
  }

  for the path /bot{token} first the handler fetches
